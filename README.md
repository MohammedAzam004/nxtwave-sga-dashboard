# 🎓 Attendance Control — Smart Attendance Management System

A production-grade, AI-powered Student Governance Assistant (SGA) built with React and Google Gemini. It provides a multi-user attendance management system with real-time session control, intelligent parent communication, risk-based monitoring, and automated weekly reporting.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional attendance tracking in educational institutions relies on manual registers, disconnected spreadsheets, and delayed parent notifications. This leads to:

- **Delayed intervention** for at-risk students
- **No real-time visibility** into session attendance
- **Poor parent communication** — parents learn about absences days later
- **Manual workload** for SGA coordinators managing approvals and reports

## 💡 Solution

Attendance Control automates the entire attendance lifecycle — from session management and self-marking to AI-generated parent alerts and weekly reports — all within a single, elegant dashboard.

## ⚙️ Core Logic Explanation

### 1. Session Lifecycle

```
Session Phase (9-10)  →  Grace Phase (10-11)  →  Closed (After 11)
    │                        │                        │
    ▼                        ▼                        ▼
Students self-mark      SGA approves pending     Pending → Absent
attendance              requests manually        Parent alerts generated
```

### 2. Attendance Request Pipeline

```
Student blocked from self-marking
        │
        ▼
Student submits reason (grace period only)
        │
        ▼
Request appears in Session Control page
        │
        ▼
SGA reviews: name, reason, attendance %, risk
        │
        ▼
SGA approves → Student marked present + request closed
```

### 3. AI Response Pipeline

```
Parent submits question
        │
        ▼
detectIntent() → greeting / irrelevant / why / improve / details
        │
        ▼
buildParentResponsePrompt() → structured prompt with student data
        │
        ▼
Gemini API call (or fallback if unavailable)
        │
        ▼
Response displayed to parent
```

### 4. Risk Calculation

```
Attendance ≥ 75%  →  LOW risk (green)
Attendance 50-74% →  MEDIUM risk (amber)
Attendance < 50%  →  HIGH risk (red)
```

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ installed
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Google Gemini API Key** (optional — app works in fallback mode without it)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAzam004/nxtwave-sga-dashboard.git
cd nxtwave-sga-dashboard

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create environment file
cp .env.example .env    # Or create manually
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
VITE_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
VITE_PARENT_EMAIL=parent@example.com
```

| Variable | Required | Description |

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **CSS PostCSS parse failure** | Fixed orphaned CSS declarations and unmatched closing braces in the stylesheet |
| **Runtime crashes from data mismatch** | `getActiveSession()` expected an array but received full student objects — corrected call sites |
| **Import naming errors** | `generateParentResponse` didn't exist — aliased correctly from `generateResponse` |
| **Pages opening mid-scroll** | Created `ScrollToTop` component that resets scroll on every route change |
| **node_modules committed to git** | Created proper `.gitignore` and removed tracked files with `git rm --cached` |
| **AI responding to irrelevant queries** | Added intent classification with `greeting` and `irrelevant` detection |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No authentication** — user roles (SGA, Student, Parent) are simulated via routing
- **No backend server** — all data persists in `localStorage` (clears on reset)
- **Single session slot** — currently supports only one time slot (9-10)
- **No real-time sync** — multiple browser tabs won't sync state
- **Gemini API dependency** — live AI features require a valid API key and internet

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add user authentication (login/signup with role-based access)
- [ ] Backend API with database persistence (MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Real-time notifications via WebSocket
- [ ] Multiple session slots per day
- [ ] Export attendance reports as PDF
- [ ] Email/SMS integration for parent alerts
- [ ] Admin analytics dashboard with charts
- [ ] Mobile-responsive PWA version
